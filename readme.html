**About Bipolar Disorder**

Bipolar disorder, or manic depression, is a serious brain disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy or functioning that can range from episodes of mania, or "highs," to episodes of depression, or "lows." These mood swings can be mild or severe and may last hours, days or months. These episodes usually begin in late adolescence, but can begin in early childhood or as late as a personâ€™s 40s or 50s.

During an episode of mania, a person may have increased mental and physical energy and exaggerated feelings of optimism or self-confidence. They may experience racing thoughts and speech and convey irrational ideas. In addition, they may exhibit reckless behavior such as embarking on spending sprees, sexual indiscretions or alcohol abuse. In a depressive episode, a person may show increased anxiety, loss of energy, social withdrawal, and feelings of guilt and hopelessness.

**Approximately 2.3 million Americans are presently diagnosed with bipolar** disorder, but the number affected by this disorder is even greater. Bipolar disorder is a chronic condition and generally requires life-long treatment. With accurate diagnosis and treatment, people with bipolar disorder can lead full and productive lives. A strategy that combines medication and psychosocial treatment is optimal for managing the disorder over time.

If left untreated, people with the disorder are at great risk for suicide, incarceration, substance abuse, job loss, or other harmful consequences. Approximately 40 percent of people with untreated bipolar disorder abuse alcohol or drugs. In addition, the mortality rate for people with untreated bipolar disorder is higher than it is for most types of heart disease and many types of cancer. Approximately 25-50 percent of people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide at least once; this is one of the highest rates for any psychiatric disorder.
